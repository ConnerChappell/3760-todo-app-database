### GET

#### /todos

Returns all todo items

### POST

#### /addNewTodo

Adds a new todo item. Works in mongo. Kind of works on the front end â€“ for me the todo item title was showing up as undefined at first but once you refresh it shows what you inputted (I don't know why this was happening) 

### PUT

(work in progress)

### DELETE

#### /deleteTodo/:todoId

Deletes a todo from the list by finding the id
